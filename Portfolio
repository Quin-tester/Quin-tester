About me
Hello, I am Quynh. I am a positive thinker with a passion for communication and problem-solving. With a solid background in accounting and auditing, I have developed logical thinking, organizational skills, and meticulous attention to detail.

I am always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. For me, every challenge is an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills. I possess the ability to analyze and creatively solve problems, regardless of whether they fall within my area of expertise.

Currently, I am eager to apply my research and analytical skills in the field of software testing. I am actively learning techniques and tools through hands-on experience from various projects, online courses, and testing web applications for educational purposes.

I have been involved in a diverse range of projects, including CRM, LMS, telecommunications, livestreaming, media, e-commerce, and gaming, across both PC and mobile platforms.

I am excited about the prospect of applying my knowledge to test real-world products and look forward to gaining further experience in various domains. My current career goal is to become a mid-level software tester within the next two years, with hopes of advancing into automation testing.
